📘 Programming Languages Studies

Welcome to my Programming Languages Studies repository!
This project contains my notes, exercises, examples, and small projects created while learning and practicing multiple programming languages and development tools.

The goal is to build a solid, organized reference that I can expand over time—covering everything from basic syntax to advanced concepts across several languages.

🚀 Technologies & Tools Covered
🧩 Languages

C — basics, pointers, structs, compilation, memory management

C++ — OOP, STL, templates, modern C++ (C++11 → C++20)

Python — scripts, OOP, modules, virtual environments

C# (.NET) — console apps, classes, LINQ, async/await

Kotlin — JVM apps, functions, null safety, OOP

🎯 Objectives

Build a multi-language reference for future projects

Practice syntax, paradigms, and tooling

Compare different programming styles

Store exercises, challenges, and experiments

Keep track of my learning progress over time

🛠 Tools Used

Ubuntu Linux

GCC / G++

.NET SDK

OpenJDK + Kotlin compiler

Python 3 + pip

PostgreSQL + pgAdmin

VS Code / IntelliJ / CLion (optional)

📘 How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mvdevelop/prog-lang-std.git
cd prog-lang-std


Navigate into any language folder and explore the examples or run the programs according to each folder’s instructions.

📈 Progress

This repository is actively updated as I continue learning.
Stay tuned for improvements, refactoring, and new mini-projects.
